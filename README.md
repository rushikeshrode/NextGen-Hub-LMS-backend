## üåê System Architecture

The system is based on a layered microservice-ready architecture:

- **Frontend (React)** ‚Üí Interacts with REST APIs
- **Backend (Spring Boot)** ‚Üí Handles business logic, security, and data access
- **MongoDB Atlas** ‚Üí Stores user, course, and progress data
- **Redis** ‚Üí Boosts performance through caching
- **External Services** ‚Üí Integrated weather API, email systems

A Load Balancer and optional Dockerization ensure scalability and deployment readiness.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
This repository is a demo copy of a larger, more advanced Learning Management System project that I have built. The purpose of this version is to showcase my ability to design and develop scalable, production-grade applications using modern full-stack technologies.
While this is not the original production repo, it demonstrates the core architecture, modular design, and technical depth I bring to real-world software projects.
